# RestauRand  

Restaurand helps you find a restaurant when you're not sure what to eat.  
The app is still in beta, with many features still not implemented.   
Features I'm trying to add:
- short google blurb for chosen restaurant
- postal code input rather than location getter
- filter options (sortby price, type of food, etc)
- view other restaurants in a list

Try it here: https://sanghoon5499.github.io/RestauRand/  
**The app will not work on FireFox.**  
If maps.html fails to load, please try refreshing the tab.
